    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>LuckyVerse.tech</strong>. This Privacy Policy applies to the main domain (LuckyVerse.tech) and all its subdomains, tools, and services, including but not limited to <strong>Jalsa Bank</strong>, our <strong>Portfolio</strong>, and future <strong>Cyber Security Projects</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
    <p>We believe in privacy first. Here is how we handle data across our services:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Main Portfolio & LinkTree:</strong> We do not collect personal data on our static portfolio pages. We may link to external social media platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub), which have their own privacy policies.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Jalsa Bank (Financial Tool):</strong> 
            <br>The Jalsa Bank interest calculator is a <strong>static, client-side tool</strong>. When you enter numbers (amounts, interest rates), all calculations happen locally on your device (browser). <strong>We do not transmit, save, or store your financial data on our servers.</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cyber Security & CTF Challenges:</strong> 
            <br>For future educational challenges, we may collect non-sensitive data such as temporary usernames or scores for leaderboards. No personally identifiable information (PII) is required.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Log Files</h2>
    <p>Like most standard websites, LuckyVerse.tech uses log files. These files may log visitors when they visit the site. The information collected includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, and referring/exit pages. This is standard for hosting services (like GitHub Pages) and is used for analytics only.</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Advertising (AdSense)</h2>
    <p>We use third-party advertising partners, such as <strong>Google AdSense</strong>, to display ads on our website to support our educational projects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.</li>
        <li>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
        <li>You may opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our website contains links to external sites (e.g., social media profiles, GitHub repositories). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.</p>
